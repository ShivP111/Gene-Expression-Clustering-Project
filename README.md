# Gene-Expression-Clustering-Project
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to cluster breast cancer samples based on their gene expression profiles. Using the publicly available GSE45827 dataset, we explore how different clustering methods group patients into biologically meaningful subtypes (Basal, LumA, LumB, Her2).
